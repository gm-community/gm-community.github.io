Cores differ in performance and energy efficiency depending on the GPU model and overclocking parameters.  To set the kernel manually, pass the kernel index to the parameter.  Try to choose the best kernel for you manually by going through all the options    --mt - allows you to choose one of several tweaks for GPUs with GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory.   A higher value gives more performance and less stability, risk of finding invalid shares increases.   Try to check all values to determine which one suits you best.  Administrator rights required.     --safe_dag - allows you to choose a way to DAG generation.  In fast mode (value 1, auto for GTX GPUs) miner generates DAG as quickly as possible, DAG errors are possible at maximum overclocking.  In safe mode (value 2, auto for RTX GPUs) miner generates DAG with error control, useful for RTX cards at maximum overclocking.   ","categories": ["documentation"],

Download   Download Now   How to use   To start Ethash, enter at the command line:   miner --algo ethash --server eth.2miners.com:2020 --user 0x5218597d48333d4a70cce91e810007b37e2937b5.worker1      --algo - mining algorithm, in this case ethash   --server - pool address and port, in this case the pool is eth.2miners.com, port is 2020   --user - Ethash wallet and worker name, in this case wallet is 0x5218597d48333d4a70cce91e810007b37e2937b5, worker is worker1   The easiest way to get a wallet is to register on a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance or Huobi.   How to set up for NiceHash   For Ethash and Etсhash algorithms, there are 2 options for stratum protocol (proxy and stratum), to explicitly specify the protocol use the “–proto” parameter, for example, to use Nicehash pool, enter in the command line:   miner --algo ethash --server daggerhashimoto.usa.nicehash.com:3353 --user 3LsTTSsSy17xuoShcMHuRgGBxKn1AHgeVN --proto stratum   How to disable GPU   If you have a mixed rig, you can run the miner only on CUDA devices:   miner --algo ethash --server eth.2miners.com:2020 --user 0x5218597d48333d4a70cce91e810007b37e2937b5.worker1 --opencl 0   or only on OpenCL devices:   miner --algo ethash --server eth.2miners.com:2020 --user 0x5218597d48333d4a70cce91e810007b37e2937b5.worker1 --cuda 0   or on devices of your choice, such as GPU0 GPU2 and GPU4:  miner --algo ethash --server eth.2miners.com:2020 --user 0x5218597d48333d4a70cce91e810007b37e2937b5.worker1 --devices 0 2 4   the list of available GPUs can be seen by calling the following command:   miner --list_devices   Temperature limit   To set temperature limits on GPU0 GPU2 and GPU4, upon reaching which mining on this device will pause until it cools down:   miner --algo ethash --server eth.2miners.com:2020 --user 0x5218597d48333d4a70cce91e810007b37e2937b5.worker1 --devices 0 2 4 --templimit 80 70 65   Where 80 is the temperature limit for GPU0, 70 is the temperature limit for GPU2, 65 is the temperature limit for GPU4   Log file   To save the miner’s logs to a file for later analysis:   miner --algo ethash --server eth.2miners.com:2020 --user 0x5218597d48333d4a70cce91e810007b37e2937b5.worker1 --logfile c: \\ log.txt   Where c:\\log.txt is the path to the file with the miner’s logs.
